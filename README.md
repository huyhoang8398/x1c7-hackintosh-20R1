<summary><strong> REQUIREMENTS </strong></summary>
<br>

- A macOS machine(optional): to create the macOS installer.
- Flash drive, 12GB or more, for the above purpose.  
- Xcode works fine for editing plist files on macOS, but I prefer [PlistEdit Pro](https://www.fatcatsoftware.com/plisteditpro/).  
- [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) if you need to edit plist files on Windows.  
- [MaciASL](https://github.com/acidanthera/MaciASL), for patching ACPI tables and editing ACPI patches.
- [MountEFI](https://github.com/corpnewt/MountEFI) to quickly mount EFI partitions.  
- [IORegistryExplorer](https://developer.apple.com/downloads), for diagnosis.  
- [Hackintool](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/335018-hackintool-v286/), for diagnostic ONLY, Hackintool should not be used for patching, it is outdated.
- Patience and time, especially if this is your first time Hackintosh-ing.
